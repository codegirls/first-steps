# Resources

A list of useful learning resources, by topic.

## General

* [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)

    covers all kinds of topics related to the web, including HTML, CSS
    and JavaScript. Mostly useful for more specific searches, but also
    has some great tutorials.

    Prefix your web searches with `mdn` to search it. For example
    searching for `mdn css background-color` will turn up the MDN docs
    on the CSS `background-color` property.
* [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/), a magazin "for people who make
    websites"

    There is a [nice overview](http://alistapart.com/topics) of the
    topic it covers.

    As a start, here is a nice article about the [`float` property](http://alistapart.com/article/css-floats-101)
    in CSS.
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) has lots of answers to
    specific questions on many programming topics.

## Tips & Techniques

* Look for something you'd like to learn ("center text on the page",
    "have a menubar at the top of my page", "make all odd paragraphs
    have this awesome backgroun") and try to do that. Often there are
    lots of tutorials on the topic and lots of code examples you can
    learn from. It's very important to do it in small steps. If you
    can't do it, try something smaller.
* Your Favourite Search Engine is your friend
* (a lot of) stumbling around is normal!
* use the developer tools of your browser

## CSS

* [A Beginner's Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/),
    explains the concepts nicely, from what i can tell
* [An Advanced Guid to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/),
    kind of a sequel to the above
* an [article](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2012/05/02/cross-browser-debugging-css/)
    about things to look out for when your CSS does weird things

## Other

* [HTMLDog](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/) has quite a few tutorials on
    HTML and CSS, but I haven't checked them out in detail yet
