# Resources

A list of useful learning resources, by topic.

## General

* [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)

    covers all kinds of topics related to the web, including HTML, CSS
    and JavaScript. Mostly useful for more specific searches, but also
    has some great tutorials.

    Prefix your web searches with `mdn` to search it. For example
    searching for `mdn css background-color` will turn up the MDN docs
    on the CSS `background-color` property.
* [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/), a magazin "for people who make
    websites"

    There is a [nice overview](http://alistapart.com/topics) of the
    topic it covers.

    As a start, here is a nice article about the [`float` property](http://alistapart.com/article/css-floats-101)
    in CSS.
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) has lots of answers to
    specific questions on many programming topics.

* [Coding Ressources Rails Girls Berlin](http://de.slideshare.net/berlintam/rails-girls-resources) An Overview about Beginners Ressources from the Rails Girls Berlin Chapter.

* [Gibbon](https://gibbon.co/playlist) Learn from the Web: Create your own playlist about a topic like CSS3 or Web Development and receive a 30 minute per week knowledge "playlist", e.g. articles or presentations. More a theoretically approach for people who want to learn more about "why".

## Tips & Techniques

* Look for something you'd like to learn ("center text on the page",
    "have a menubar at the top of my page", "make all odd paragraphs
    have this awesome background") and try to do that. Often there are
    lots of tutorials on the topic and lots of code examples you can
    learn from. It's very important to do it in small steps. If you
    can't do it, try something smaller.
* Your Favourite Search Engine is your friend
* (a lot of) stumbling around is normal!
* Don't give up, take a break, watch a cute kitty video and try again. Most times, once you cleared you mind, the solution is found much easier.
* use the developer tools of your browser

## Tools

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/), has very cool features for
    live-coding, but probably only useful in this project if we're going
    to use JavaScript.

* [NeoCities](https://neocities.org/), allows anyone to easily publish
    simple web pages.

* [Code School - Try Git](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) 15 minute introduction to git.
* [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) A Walk Through Guide for git

## CSS

* [A Beginner's Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/),
    explains the concepts nicely, from what i can tell
* [An Advanced Guid to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/),
    kind of a sequel to the above
* an [article](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2012/05/02/cross-browser-debugging-css/)
    about things to look out for when your CSS does weird things
* a [nice article](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-best-way-to-learn-css--webdesign-11906)
    with a few suggestions on what to do in which order (has some links
    to paid courses though, but the advice is still good)
* [CSS Diner- Where we feast on CSS Selectors](http://flukeout.github.io/)  A little game developed by the Rails Girls Berlin CHapter. 

## Other

* [HTMLDog](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/) has quite a few tutorials on
    HTML and CSS, but I haven't checked them out in detail yet
