# Modules

This is just a rough draft of ideas for the structure of the module:

* Build on Website from Scratch using HTML
* Hack a Site to learn about code other people use; goal: Lern to use developer tools
* Site is broken and user has to fix it --> Bug Finding
* Improve your site using CSS 

## Questions

Typical questions in the module could include somethings like this.

* How would integrate an image? Or an link? Encourage one's own initiative to explore learning ressources to find a solution.
* make your own [Histagram](http://histagrams.com)

## Building the App

* First, build the end product and then try and figure out how to deconstruct it in logical steps.
* The Basic idea: Building different HTML sites and link them.
* Whole Site will be hosted on github
* Estimated amount of HTML sites: 25
* Lucas will build the first example tutorial and show us whats possible with basic HTML. From there we'll build the other tutorials.
* Estimated Time frame: 2 months. 

## What's the endgame?

* Basis HTML
* Basic CSS + Layout
* How to use Developer Tools
* Be able to find support on the Internet
* Basic Q&A (Bugs)
