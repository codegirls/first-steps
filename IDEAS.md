## First Steps (Tutorial)

## 1. The Reason
To simplify the access into the fantastic world of __HTML__ and __CSS__ for our absolut beginners we would like to build a simple app. The app should bundle our and especially Lucas efforts from former _Code Girls_ sessions. This would cover mostly the __Hacker-blog__ experience you can find on github [here](https://github.com/heyLu/codegirls/blob/master/2013-10-22-hacker-blog-pt-1.md), [here] (https://github.com/heyLu/codegirls/blob/master/2013-11-05-hacker-blog-pt-2.md) and [here](https://github.com/heyLu/codegirls/commit/c87a583312712b8f9dfb6baa7b154fc49439c222). We would like to have all sorts of materials: combinend with continuative links, suggestions for google-ing, build-in examples in web-editors and little projects the girls can manage by themselves, classified into logical and consecutive chapters. The chapters should ideally be based on and another. 
Maybe we can even build in a tool, which allows the users to connect and / or the admins to see, which user is on which level. 

_Important: This should not be something the girls just click through but a real learning experience, where they need to master little tasks by using by previous aquired knowledge, while gaining new skills and experimenting with new code._


## 2. Examples

Example for a chapter with a task in build-in web editor: [Tryit Editor v1.9](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_keyframes)

A [similar editor](https://thimble.webmaker.org/) made by Mozilla, part of a [larger project](https://webmaker.org/)
that aims to make it easier to create for the web and get started.
